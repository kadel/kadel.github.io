      <description>This year during the first week of August (2-5.8.2016) I attended Flock to Fedora conference in Krakow. This was my first time at Flock and I must say it was a great event.
Big thumbs up to all the organizers for putting it together. All the talks that I saw were great. And evening activities were even better :wink:. Every conference night there was some social event prepared for all conference attendees.</description>
